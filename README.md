## esoTalk â€“ Fat-free forum software

**Help develop *Flarum*, esoTalk's successor. [Flarum on GitHub &raquo;](https://github.com/flarum/core)**

esoTalk is a free, open-source forum software package built with PHP and MySQL. It is designed to be:

 - **Fast.** esoTalk's code was architectured to have little overhead and to be as efficient as possible.
 - **Simple.** All of esoTalk's interfaces are designed around simplicity, ease-of-use, and speed.
 - **Powerful.** Despite its simplicity, a large array of [plugins](http://esotalk.org/plugins) and [skins](http://esotalk.org/skins) are available to extend the functionality of esoTalk.

esoTalk is developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother, Simon.
